**2D NIM GAME:**

A player-vs-computer 2D NIM game of NxN dimensions, *10 ‚â• ùëÅ ‚â• 1*. 3 different strategies available for the computer. The computer plays according to the selected strategy until there's only 5 or less empty cells left, after which it plays in a way that allows it to win (provided there is such a move). 

**NASH EQUILIBRIUM DETECTOR:**

Creates a random bimatrix game of user-defined dimensions and detects the Nash equilibria of the game (provided they exist). 4 different algorithms available for constructing Nash equilibria. Also calculates the approximation guarantees of the discovered equilibria. Can be used to conduct large-scale experiments by running an algorithm multiple times and producing graphs of the corresponding approximation guarantees.
